Population Statistics 
 
4.1.1 A country’s development is shaped to a considerable extent by its population 
demographics and dynamics, which are, or should be, shaped by development policy 
and progress. Understanding the interplay between gender and population 
demographics and dynamics is essential for formulating and implementing policies and 
programmes that aim to change a country’s environmental, socio-political and 
economic demographics, dynamics and development prospects. Analysis of population 
composition from gender perspective is very central in understanding the nitty-gritty of 
social structure of a society. Two major factors play a critical role in shaping the 
population composition, one attributes to biological or natural causes and other 
attributes to human behavior. 
Population demographics and dynamics 
4.1.2 As per Census 2011, India’s population was 121.1 Crore with 48.5% female 
population and the total population is expected to reach to 152.2 crore during 2036 with 
a slightly improved percentage of female population (48.8). Population growth has been 
slowing down from an average annual growth rate of 2.2% in 1971 to 1.1 % in 2021 
which is projected to further fall to 0.58% in 2036. Similar trend is observed in case of 
both males and females during this period except for a small increase in respect of 
females from 1971 to 1981. (Table 1.1).

show a wavering trend, reaching to its lowest (938) in 1991 with an increasing trend in 
the next two census years.  In urban areas, it has been increasing during the period 1971 
to 2011. However, sex ratio in case of rural areas is expected to increase from 949 in 
2011 to 969 in 2036 whereas in urban areas it is expected to hover around 929 with a

are projected to increase considerably during this period (Table 1.2). Accordingly, the 
population pyramid will undergo a shift as the base of the pyramid in 2036 would 
narrow down, while the middle would be broadened. This is true for both the sexes.

Dependency Ratio 
4.1.5 The dependency ratio is the number of children (age 0-14 years) and older 
persons (age 60 years and above) per 100 working age population (15-59 years). 
Changes in the dependency ratio provide an indication of the potential social support 
requirements resulting from changes in population age structures. In addition, the ratio 
highlights the potential dependency burden on working population and indicates the

4.1.4 Changes in the size of working-age population plays a key role in determining 
the size of labour force and direction of inter-state labour migration. Given changing 
age composition, India’s working-age population will continue to increase through 
2036. According to Report of the Technical Group on Population Projections for India 
and States 2011-2036, 735 million people or 60.7% of India’s population was in the 
working age group i.e. 15-59 years in 2011 and this population group is expected to 
increase over the years and would reach 988.5 million in 2036 (Statement 4.1, Figure

24,"shifts in dependency, as we are going from a situation in which children are dominant 
to the situation in which older persons outnumber children (i.e, the transition from high 
mortality and high fertility, to low mortality and low fertility). A high dependency ratio 
indicates that the economically active population and the overall economy face a greater 
burden to support and provide the social services needed by children and by older 
persons who are often economically dependent. It is clear without saying that a high 
dependency ratio will increase the burden of unpaid care work, which most often falls 
upon women due to gender roles ascribed by societies. 
4.1.6 Due to increasing longevity, population 60 years and above are projected to 
increase from 101.5 million in 2011 to 227.4 million in 2036. Simultaneously, with 
India having made significant progress in achieving population control with TFR below 
replacement level of fertility of 2.1, the young age (0-14 years) population is projected 
to fall from 373.9 million to 306.4 million during the same period. These amount to a 
fall in dependency ratio from 65% in 2011 to 54% in 2036.  
Sex Ratio 
4.1.7 As per Report of the Technical Group on Population Projections for India and 
States 2011-2036, the sex ratio (females per 1000 males) in 2036 is expected to be more 
favourable to women compared to the 2011. (Table 1.1).

to migration of males from rural to urban.  The only States/UTs with a favorable sex 
ratio in 2011 are Kerala and Puducherry (Table 1.3).  
4.1.9    As per Census 2011, Sex ratio in the age-groups 0-6, 15-59 and 60+ has been 
observed as 918, 944 and 1033 respectively (Table 1.4).  
4.1.10  Sex Ratio at Birth for the country has gone up by 3 points to 907 in 2018-20 
from 904 in 2017-19. Kerala has reported the highest Sex Ratio at Birth (974) while 
Uttarakhand, the lowest (844). Only 3 States viz., Kerala, Chhatisgarh and Himachal 
Pradesh have sex ratio at birth close to or more than national sex ratio at birth (Table 
1.6)."
